<h2> Reflections </h3>
<p> The similarities between python and scratch are the loops and if else statements. They are different from one another, because, scratch has blocks that clearly state the intent of the code. In python you must type everything out, and it isn't as straightforward as the blocks. </p>
<p> I did not enjoy debugging the code just because I am the type of person who likes things to work once I've thought about them. It was hard because I did not have any experience in python so it was confusing trying to figure out how everything should work, and it was very hard. </p>
<hr>
<p> A list is a list of numbers, or things that are kept in brackets that starts being counted from zero. It is useful if you want to call something from a long list, and change it or just do something to it. </p>
<p> I think that all of the groups that I worked in today worked really well. I worked with Meg on our text adventure game and I think that it was a success. I worked with Hope on the filters and we created five different filters which was really cool. </p>
<p> I enjoyed choosing the colors for filters because it was fun to think about what colors would look the best together. It was hard starting out because we didn't know where to begin the code. But once we got some help it all made sense and came together quickly. We used every element of the core four.We used variables, functions, loops, and booleans. If I could make any filter I wanted, it would be a filter that recognized what I was saying, and wrote them down at the bottom of the screen like closed captions. The highlight of today was CSS for me, because I really enjoyed the cosmetic aspect of making a website. It took forever to get the font that I wanted, but in the end when I made it the font I wanted, it was extremely fulfilling.

<p> When we were making the circuit it was hard for us to make the parallel. We required a lot of help from the teachers and other students, but we eventually got the circuit to work properly. </p>
