<p> The similarities between python and scratch are the loops and if else statements. They are different from one another, because, scratch has blocks that clearly state the intent of the code. In python you must type everything out, and it isn't as straightforward as the blocks. </p>
<p> I did not enjoy debugging the code just because I am the type of person who likes things to work once I've thought about them. It was hard because I did not have any experience in python so it was confusing trying to figure out how everything should work, and it was very hard. </p>

<p> A list is a list of numbers, or things that are kept in brackets that starts being counted from zero. It is useful if you want to call something from a long list, and change it or just do something to it. </p>
<p> I think that all of the groups that I worked in today worked really well. I worked with Meg on our text adventure game and I think that it was a success. I worked with Hope on the filters and we created five different filters which was really cool. </p>
